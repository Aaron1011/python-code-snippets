= Python web test =

Detect web handler: mod_wsgi, fast_CGI, mod_python or CGI and display many informations.

* **python_test.py** displays many informations.
* **python_test_mini.py** is smaller and displays less informations.

== HowTo ==

Put the files **.htaccess**, **python_test.py** and/or **python_test_mini.py** into
your htdocs directory. Change .htaccess for your needs.

== logging ==

The test script write some logs into a log file. The problem is, to find a place
for this log file. Depending on the user that runs the process, we have different
file write rights and we try to find a filepath in which we can write out log output.

We try to create a log file in these directories:
* same directory as test script
* tempfile.gettempdir()
* ~/tmp
* /tmp

== Which handler? ==

How to find out what the handler is running script?

=== mod_wsgi ===
{{{
if __name__.startswith('_mod_wsgi_'):
    # we running with mod_wsgi
}}}
or:
{{{
if sys.argv[0] == "mod_wsgi":
    # we running with mod_wsgi
}}}

=== mod_python ===
{{{
if __name__.startswith('_mp_'):
    # we running with mod_python
}}}
or:
{{{
if sys.argv[0] == "mod_python":
    # we running with mod_python
}}}


=== fastCGI, fcgid or CGI ? ===

It seems to be difficult to keep them apart. The current solution looks like this:
{{{
if __name__ == "__main__":
    if "CGI" in os.environ.get("GATEWAY_INTERFACE", ""):
        # normal CGI
    elif "PATH" in os.environ:
        # New libapache2-mod-fcgid Apache module
    else:
        # Old libapache2-mod-fastcgi Apache module
}}}

Does anyone have a better idea?
